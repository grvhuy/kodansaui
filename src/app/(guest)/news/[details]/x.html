      BREAKER</cite></a> is a popular series currently being serialized on the K Manga app with English volumes being
  released in print and digital by Kodansha USA! On April of 2024, the anime’s first season was released, and it was
  received incredibly well across the world. Now, a second season has been officially announced for April 2025!</p>
<p dir="ltr">To celebrate the upcoming second season, we bring you a special interview with the author of <cite>WIND
    BREAKER</cite>, Satoru Nii-sensei!</p>
<hr>
<p dir="ltr"><cite><strong>Kodansha: </strong>WIND BREAKER</cite> was received really well following its serialization,
  and the response to the anime’s first season was very positive. Now, finally, a second season following the events of
  the first has been announced for April 2025. We’ve heard that many fans of the series are incredibly excited about the
  news.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For today, we’d like to dive into this hit manga. Thank you for joining us today.</p>
<p><strong>Satoru Nii:</strong> And thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Kodansha:</strong> First off, we’d like to ask a bit about the theme. What made you want to draw a story
  about delinquents? Delinquent manga is one of the most beloved genres in Japan with a long history. But <cite>WIND
    BREAKER</cite> seems to break the mold with a different atmosphere and leaves a unique impression for this genre.
</p>
<p><strong>Satoru Nii:</strong>&nbsp;Actually, I didn’t start <cite>WIND BREAKER</cite> wanting to make a delinquent
  manga. It felt more like I was drawing a sports manga. People say that fighting is like a sports competition, after
  all. What’s more, there’s also the added tension and excitement from fighting off the enemy and the gratitude that
  comes with it that you’d normally find in the Sentai genre. That might be why it gives off a different atmosphere and
  impression.</p>
<p><strong>Kodansha: </strong>What was your initial concept for this title?</p>
<p><strong>Satoru Nii: </strong>“I want to draw a feel-good manga with a bunch of cool boys in it.” That’s where it all
  started, and as I planned the series further, it became a current-world story with modern characters that ended up
  being closer to a delinquent manga.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kodansha: </strong>Thank you for your answers. Now, about the setting, I think one of the most attractive
  aspects of <cite>WIND BREAKER</cite> comes from all of the alluring characters who have gone through different
  experiences. Which character do you feel most attached to?</p>
<p><strong>Satoru Nii: </strong>I love all of the characters, and I’m attached to each and every one of them in their
  own way. But the main character, Sakura, was particularly difficult to create, so I think I might be especially
  attached to him. At first, I wanted to draw a story about a character that’s like Umemiya, so I was set in making him
  the main character. But unfortunately, it didn’t work out. That was when I made Sakura to take up the mantle as the
  main character. He’s supposed to be the main character, but he’s mentally weak, which makes his actions inconsistent
  with his thoughts. I remember I had trouble creating him while I grappled with what things Sakura might like or
  dislike. But I’m glad I went through the struggles with him, because that was how Sakura, a character that many people
  have come to love, was born.</p>
<p><strong>Kodansha: </strong>Among the colorful cast, there are many fans of the new characters that will get their
  spotlight in the anime’s second season in April 2025, like Kaji and Tsubakino. Can you tell us how you came up with
  these characters?</p>
<p><strong>Satoru Nii:</strong> When I come up with characters, I normally go through either of two different patterns:
  I start with a visual image and create the character from there, or the character’s role and personality is developed
  first. For Kaji, I created his visual appearance first. He was designed to be the “cool” character, but what I ended
  up with is a character that’s far from cool, haha.</p>
<p><strong>Kodansha: </strong>A lot of fans really like his relationship with Hiragi. Was this relationship planned from
  the start?</p>
<p><strong>Satoru Nii: </strong>In the beginning, Kaji was created as Hiragi’s kohai, as someone who was saved by
  Hiragi, and someone who looked up to Hiragi so much, he decided to follow after him. &nbsp;The details, though, were
  then gradually developed after.</p>
<p><strong>Kodansha: </strong>I see! Now, may I ask about how Tsubakino was created?</p>
<p><strong>Satoru Nii: </strong>Tsubakino was planned from the start before serialization even began. Of all of the Four
  Heavenly Kings, Tsubakino is probably the most deeply defined. When it was decided that the story will take place in
  an all-boys’ school, I wanted to create a character who visually looked more feminine. That was how Tsubakino’s
  concept started. Then, I began to really dig into his character, and personally, I really like Tsubakino as well.</p>
<p><strong>Kodansha: </strong>He loves cute things, and he loves Umemiya too. He’s a character that has many unique
  scenes that leaves a powerful impression on the reader.</p>
<p><strong>Satoru Nii:</strong> I agree. “I feel more motivated when I feel cute and pretty, and life is just more fun
  that way. That’s why I always want to be like this.” That’s one of the important core values for this character. That
  being said, Tsubakino identifies as a male. He just happens to like a lot of feminine clothes and things that females
  are more likely to enjoy. He loves Umemiya, which means that he’s attracted to men, but he doesn’t hate himself for
  it. He has also accepted that his love will never be reciprocated. Tsubakino is just a character that is honest to
  himself and others about what he loves.</p>
<p><strong>Kodansha: </strong>Next, can you tell us a little about your workflow? What is the normal process for the
  weekly schedule?</p>
<p><strong>Satoru Nii:</strong> First, I have meetings with the editor on Mondays. I have until Wednesday to come up
  with the storyboard, then my assistants come in starting on Thursdays and we work through the rest of the week to
  Sunday to complete the drawings. Sometimes when I don’t have enough time for the storyboard, I have to make it while
  creating the initial draft…and honestly, that’s usually how things end up, haha.</p>
<p><strong>Kodansha: </strong>Y-You don’t get much time to rest, huh?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Satoru Nii:</strong> And while all that is happening, I still have to supervise the anime and game, look over
  the merchandise, do some extra work for the volume releases, and draw bonuses. Haha. It might sound like I don’t get
  any rest, but I follow my schedule pretty strictly, and I make sure to take my breaks. I don’t go through sleepless
  nights or anything like that. I’m the type that can’t get any work done without any sleep. If anything, I think I
  sleep quite a lot, haha.</p>
<p><strong>Kodansha:</strong>That’s great to hear! My next question is…which part of the workflow do you like the most?
</p>
<p><strong>Satoru Nii:</strong>&nbsp;It’s probably when I ink the characters. When I draw, I start with a rough sketch.
  It isn’t until I ink it when the lines become clearer. It feels like I can actually see the drawings get finished,
  haha.</p>

<p><strong>Kodansha: </strong><cite>WIND BREAKER</cite> seems to be extremely popular overseas as well! What are your
  thoughts on the overseas fans’ strong enthusiasm for the series</p>
<p><strong>Satoru Nii:</strong>&nbsp;I am deeply touched by how well <cite>WIND BREAKER</cite> is being received. I’m
  really happy. It’s a strange feeling to know that the pages I’m drawing on my small table is reaching all these people
  across the world. When I am physically there at signing events overseas, I get to meet so many fans and see that the
  story has reached them. It’s an emotional experience. I feel an immense gratitude to all the fans. Thank you so much
  for your constant support.</p>
<p><strong>Kodansha: </strong>Lastly, can you tell us a little bit about what we can look forward to for Sakura and the
  rest of Bofurin?</p>
<p><strong>Satoru Nii:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve already decided on the goal for this title. There are still so much
  development and character stories that I want to draw. I believe that all the fans will get the chance to learn about
  these characters better at a deeper level. Please look forward to it!</p>
